        <p class="aboutme-content">About Me (Background))
          I was born in Irvine, California, and spent much of my life in Japan, where I developed a strong interest in both technology and cross-cultural communication. This diverse background has shaped the way I approach problem-solving, teamwork, and innovation in web development.
          
          Currently, I’m pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at BYU-Idaho, with plans to specialize in front-end web development. My goal is to join the web development industry, focusing on website coding and a bit of design, but I’m also interested in expanding into marketing, business management, and e-commerce. While I haven’t worked specifically in these areas yet, I’m eager to learn and integrate them with my technical skills. The combination of web development and business management excites me, and I believe these fields are interconnected and offer plenty of opportunities for growth.
          
          Additionally, I value collaboration and prefer working in teams over solo projects. I believe that group work fosters better problem-solving, creativity, and communication, all of which are essential for success in the tech and business worlds.</p>
